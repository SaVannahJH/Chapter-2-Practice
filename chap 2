# 2-1 Simple Message
# Assign a message to a varible and print 
books= "Harry Potter is the best book!"
print(books)

# 2-2 Simple Messages
# Assign a message to a variable and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message and print the new message
test_score= "You got a 100% on the math test"
print(test_score)

test_score= "You got a 78% on the math test"
print(test_score)

# 2-3. Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”
sierra="Hello Sierra, Would you like to learn some Python today?"
print (sierra)

# 2-4. Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.
name=" Nancy"
print(name.lower())
print(name.upper())
print(name.title())

# 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. 
# Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks: 
# Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
print(Doland Trump once said: "America First")

# 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your message.
famous_person= Donald Trump
message= "America First"
print(famous_person)
print(message)

# 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
person=   Norma   


# 2-8. File Extensions: Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extension, like some file browsers do.
file= www.google.com
print(file.removesuffix(www.))
print(file.removeprefix())
