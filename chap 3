# 3-1. Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
friends=[Cora, Sierra, Sonia, Rachel]
print(friends[0])
print(friends[1])
print(friends[2])
print(friends[3])

# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
# The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
friends=[Cora, Sierra, Sonia, Rachel]
print(f" You are my BBF {friends[0]} and sister for life!")
print(f" You were my BBF in highschool {friends[1]}!")
print(f" You are my second friend {friends[2]}! Friends for life I say")
print(f" You are my sassiest sister and freind {friends[3]}!")


# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
# Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
Cars=[Cybertruck, Ford Exursion, SUV, Ford Bronco 1978, Eagle Talon]
print(f" I think {cars[0]} are intersesting !")
print( f" My father own three {cars[1]} and they all are over 20 years old")
print(f" My mom wants an {cars[2]} for her birthday")
print(f" My fathers favorite car is a {car[3]} and he owns 2 of them")
print(f" My mom owns a {cars[-1]}!")

# 3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? 
# Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. 
# Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
guests=[Jesus, Moses, God, John the Bapsist,]
print(f"Hello {guests[0]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[1]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[2]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[-1]} will you join me for dinner?")

# 3-5. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. 
# You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
# Start with your program from Exercise 3-4. 
# Add a print() call at the end of your program, stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
# Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
# Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
guests=[Jesus, Moses, God, John the Bapsist,]
print(f"Hello {guests[0]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[1]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[2]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[-1]} will you join me for dinner?")

print(f"{guest[-1]} cant make dinner")
new_guests=guests.insert(-1,"Mark")
print(new_guests)
print(f"Hello {new_guests[0]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {new_guests[1]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {new_guests[2]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {new_guests[-1]} will you join me for dinner?")

# 3-6. More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
# Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or 3-5. 
# Add a print() call to the end of your program, informing people that you found a bigger table.
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
# Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
# Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
print(new_guests)
print(f"Hello {new_guests[0]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {new_guests[1]} will you join me for dinner?")

more_guests=new_guests.insert(1,"Mary")

print(f"Hello {more_guests[1]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {more_guests[2]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {more_guests[3]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {more_guests[4]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {more_guests[-1]} will you join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {new_guests[-2]} will you join me for dinner?")

# 3-7. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and now you have space for only two guests.
# Start with your program from Exercise 3-6. 
# Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
# Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. 
# Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
# Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
# Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. 
# Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

# 3-8. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.
# Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.
# Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly; just print it as a raw Python list.
# Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.
# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
# Use sorted() to print your list in reverse-alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
# Use reverse() to change the order of your list. 
# Print the list to show that its order has changed.
# Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. 
# Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.
# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. 
# Print the list to show that its order has been changed.
# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse-alphabetical order. 
# Print the list to show that its order has changed.

# 3-9. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 3-4 through 3-7 (pages 41–42), 
# use len() to print a message indicating the number of people you’re inviting to dinner.
print(two_guests)
print(f" hey I'm inviting {len(two_guests)} to dinner tonight")

# 3-10. Every Function: Think of things you could store in a list. 
# For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. 
# Write a program that creates a list containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.

# 3-11. Intentional Error: If you haven’t received an index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. 
# Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
